# RFID-NFC-Scanner

This project is something I've been working on for a short while to get used to the microcontroller communication protocol, as well as a small introduction to PHP and HTTP requests. The idea came from my roommates and me hearing of a break-in in the neighborhood, and I thought that making an internally managed security system would be a smart idea.
